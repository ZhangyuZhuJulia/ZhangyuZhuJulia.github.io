### Procedures:

1. Data prepartion<br>

* Getting Insights from Large and un-organized dataset<br>

Based on the goal to predict if members will continue opioid therapy six months after initial prescribing, we think backward about possible causation leads to this result and combine variables to generate new information that will help build the prediction model <br>
